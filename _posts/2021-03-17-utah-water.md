This March, a ProPublica report alleged Georgia Senator Kelly Loeffler and North Carolina Senator Richard Burr sold stocks on February 13 after receiving briefings in the Senate Intelligence Committee. About a week after these liquidations, the stocks sold by both Loeffler and Burr had a steep drop in value.

Both Loeffler and Burr deny any wrongdoing, claiming the sales were just “business as usual.” Advocacy group Common Cause is not satisfied with this excuse as they filed complaints against Burr and Loeffler for STOCK Act violations.
Taking a closer look at Loeffler, she was appointed to the Senate by Georgia Governor Brian Kemp at the end of 2019 when her predecessor Johnny Isakson resigned on December 31, 2019. Her husband, Jeffery Specher is the Chairman of the New York Stock Exchange and its parent company, Intercontinental Exchange.
Richard Burr is in his third term as the Senior senator from North Carolina. Burr’s stock sell-off raised concerns when a recording from NPR showed that Burr had warned an exclusive group of VIPs of the incoming economic downfall comparing it to the 1918 Flu pandemic after telling the public that “the United States today is better prepared than ever before….” 
Interestingly, Burr’s brother, Gerald Fauth, also sold stocks on the same day as Burr. According to an analysis of Fauth’s financials by ProPublica it seems Fauth does not often trade stocks. That raises the question, was Fauth acting on privileged information provided by his brother?
These potential violations of the STOCK Act are just that, potential violations. With appropriate investigation the truth about this potential misconduct should come out.
However, two senators sold stocks after receiving private information from a CDC briefing. The first, Loeffler, was unelected, appointed by Kemp: The Governor who sparked controversy when he continued working as the Secretary of State overseeing his own election and considered an “enemy to democracy” by Emory professor Carol Anderson. She is also married to the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange. Burr, in contrast, has no such complications in his past.
